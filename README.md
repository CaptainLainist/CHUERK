# WARNING

It has come to my attention some people have been putting chuerk on pirated software sites, just a daily reminder that chuerk is free both as in money and as in freedom and you can download it easily on releases.
I have no problem with people distributing my software, but be aware that those sites could inject malware in chuerk.
